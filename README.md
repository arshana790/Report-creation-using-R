# Report-creation-using-R

To make this report i have used exploratory analysis and model fitting. I used the housePrice dataset for the report.

Please note that when i created the report, I was unable to knit the R markdwon file into a pdf file in my pc. Therefore i knited the pdf file via a friend.  when he run the project some values changed (due to train data and test data). The accuracy of the model and predicted values, error of the model were changed. The values are different from what i wrote for my report. Please note that in the project all of my values are stated correctly. 
Thank you.
